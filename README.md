# Pi Zero Time Lapse Camera

Background

When my daughter got her first (deactivated) hand-me-down Google Pixel phone last spring, she was excited to have a camera of her own. She started taking pictures of the willow tree in our backyard every morning. She wanted to make a timelapse of the willow tree. There was a slight problem, she was not always capturing same angle, same time of day and some days she forgot to take pictures in the rush to get to school and other activities. So as daddy-daughter project we built a camera using a raspberry pi that would do the work for us. This repository outlines the work we did and provides instruction to anyone who maybe interested in doing the same.
