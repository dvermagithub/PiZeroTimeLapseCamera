# Pi Zero Time Lapse Camera 
## Background 
When my daughter got her first (deactivated) hand-me-down Google Pixel phone last spring, she was excited to have a camera of her own. She started taking pictures of the willow tree in our backyard every morning. She wanted to make a timelapse of the willow tree sprouting leaves.  
There was a slight problem with her approach though - she was not always capturing pictures from the same angle, or at same time of day and some days she conmpletely forgot to take pictures in the rush to get to school and other activities.  
So as "daddy-daughter project" we built a camera using a raspberry pi zero that would do the work for her. This repository outlines the work we did and provides instruction to anyone who maybe interested in doing the same.
